A simple to use script to plot CSV files using [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).


## Current Features

## (Maybe) Future Features

- Plotting different columns with an alternate Y-Axis.
- Multiple subplots in a single plot.
- Saving and restoring plot configurations in e.g. a YAML file for an easy reuse of common plotting setups.
